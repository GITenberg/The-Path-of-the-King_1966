description: Best known for penning the spy thriller The Thirty-Nine Steps, author
  and politician John Buchan produced dozens of fiction and non-fiction works over
  the course of his career. The Path of the King is a sprawling epic that takes the
  reader on a trip through the lives of centuries' worth of kings and leaders, beginning
  in ancient times and ending with a surprising twist in nineteenth-century America.
  Fans of fast-paced historical fiction will love this inventive novel.
